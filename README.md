# Bookmark Manager

An app to manage bookmarks and access your favourite websites. This may evolve into something more specific over time, I'll see where it takes me. Fridge manager, anyone 😅?

Tech:

Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;
